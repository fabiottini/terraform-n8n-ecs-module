## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this Terraform module, please report it responsibly:

### Private Reporting

Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please send an email to: **[your-security-email@domain.com]**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity and complexity

## Security Considerations

### Infrastructure Security

This module implements several security best practices:

- **VPC Isolation**: All application resources deployed in private subnets
- **Encryption**: TLS in transit, encryption at rest for RDS and ElastiCache
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access patterns
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **Network Security**: Security groups with restrictive rules

### Data Protection

- **Database Encryption**: RDS instances use encryption at rest
- **Backup Security**: Automated backups with encryption
- **Secrets Handling**: No secrets stored in Terraform state
- **Access Logging**: CloudTrail integration for audit trails

### Operational Security

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All changes tracked in version control
- **State Management**: Terraform state stored securely in S3 with encryption
- **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication recommended
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for security events

## Security Best Practices

When using this module:

1. **AWS Account Security**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail
   - Use AWS Organizations for account management
   - Implement strong IAM policies
   - Enable GuardDuty for threat detection

2. **Network Security**
   - Use private subnets for application resources
   - Implement WAF for public endpoints (manual setup)
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs
   - Regular security group audits

3. **Application Security**
   - Regular updates of container images
   - Vulnerability scanning of Docker images
   - Regular rotation of secrets and passwords
   - Enable application-level logging

4. **Operational Security**
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Regular access reviews
   - Secure Terraform state management
   - Regular backup testing

## Known Security Considerations

### Network Access

- Load balancers are internet-facing by default
- Consider using internal load balancers for internal access only
- Webhook endpoints should implement proper authentication

### Database Access

- Database is only accessible from application subnets
- Consider enabling enhanced monitoring for RDS
- Regular security updates for database engine

### Container Security

- Container images should be regularly updated
- Consider using Amazon ECR for private image repository
- Implement container vulnerability scanning

## Compliance

This module supports common compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2**: Through AWS service compliance and proper configuration
- **PCI DSS**: Additional configuration required for payment data
- **HIPAA**: Additional BAA and configuration required
- **GDPR**: Data residency and encryption features available

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

**Email**: [your-security-email@domain.com]  
**Response Time**: Within 48 hours for security issues

For general questions, please use GitHub Issues or Discussions.
